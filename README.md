# TheFermion's Custom CSS Settings

## Description

TheFermion's Custom CSS, representing my personal collection for Obsidian, is crafted to enhance the user interface through the Style Settings plugin [^1]. This comprehensive repository offers an array of customization options, allowing effortless adjustments to various elements. Users can fine-tune accent colors, typography for reading and editing views, and refine text highlighting and mathematical renderings using STIX Two Math according to personal preferences.

Furthermore, this collection includes customization options to improve readability by adding paragraph indents, justifying text in both editor and preview modes, and removing underlines from links. The plugin's settings section enables fine-tuning of elements such as the Pandoc reference list icon, the appearance of the Better Command Palette pane, and even the thickness of underlines in folder notes.

This personal collection aims to empower Obsidian users, enabling them to tailor their experience to their specific preferences and enhance overall usability.
